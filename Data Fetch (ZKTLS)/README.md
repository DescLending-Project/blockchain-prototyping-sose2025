# Verifiable Data Fetching with TLS Notary

This section of the project demonstrates a method for securely fetching data using **TLS Notary** for verifiability.

**Key Features:**
- Ensures the integrity and authenticity of fetched data.
- Leverages TLS Notary to provide cryptographic proof for the data received.
- Useful for applications requiring trustless proof of data origin.
