## üõ†Ô∏è **Utility Scripts**

#### **`copy-artifacts.js`**
- **Purpose**: Copy contract artifacts to frontend
- **Usage**: `npx hardhat run scripts/copy-artifacts.js`
- **Function**: Copies ABIs and addresses for frontend integration
- **Target**: Updates frontend contract interfaces

#### **`update-app-addresses.js`**
- **Purpose**: Update contract addresses in application config
- **Usage**: `npx hardhat run scripts/update-app-addresses.js`

---

## üìã **Usage Examples**

### **Complete System Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy complete system with ZK features
npx hardhat run scripts/deployAll-ZK.js --network localhost

## üìä **Gas Analysis Workflow**

### **For Production Deployment Planning**
1. **Start Local Node**: `npx hardhat node`
2. **Run Production Analysis**: `npx hardhat run scripts/productionGasAnalysis.js --network localhost`
3. **Review Production Costs**: Real contracts only, no test overhead

### **For Development and Testing**
1. **Start Local Node**: `npx hardhat node`
2. **Run Complete Analysis**: `npx hardhat run scripts/runGasAnalysis.js --network localhost`
3. **Review Reports**: Check generated `.md` and `.json` files
4. **Individual Analysis**: Run specific scripts as needed

---

## üöÄ **Deployment Workflow**

1. **Choose Deployment Script**: Based on features needed
2. **Set Network**: Configure target network
3. **Run Deployment**: Execute chosen script
4. **Update Frontend**: Run `copy-artifacts.js`
5. **Update Config**: Run `update-app-addresses.js`

---

## üìù **Notes**

- **Gas analysis scripts** require a running local Hardhat node
- **Production gas analysis** measures only real contracts (no mocks)
- **Development gas analysis** includes mock contracts for testing
- **Deployment scripts** can target any configured network
- **ZK scripts** require RISC0 verifier setup
- **All scripts** include comprehensive error handling
- **Output files** are generated in the backend directory

### **Production vs Development Gas Analysis**
- **Use `productionGasAnalysis.js`** for real deployment cost planning
- **Use `gasAnalysis.js`** for development and testing with mocks
- **Production analysis** excludes MockToken, MockPriceFeed, MockTimelock
- **Production analysis** includes real ZK verifiers and governance contracts

## üßπ **Cleanup Completed**

**Removed 30+ non-essential scripts including:**
- Debug scripts
- Duplicate deployment scripts  
- Development-only test scripts
- Deprecated functionality scripts
- Temporary fix scripts

**Kept 12 essential scripts** for production use, gas analysis, and core functionality.
