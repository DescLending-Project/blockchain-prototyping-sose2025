# Block Tag Error - Complete Solution

## Error Description
```
Contract initialization error: Error: Contract call failed. Please check if contracts are properly deployed and network is correct. Details: could not coalesce error (error={ "code": -32603, "data": { "cause": null, "code": -32000, "data": { "data": null, "message": "Received invalid block tag 98. Latest block number is 29" }, "message": "Received invalid block tag 98. Latest block number is 29" }, "message": "Internal JSON-RPC error." }
```

## Root Cause
This error occurs when:
1. **Hardhat node was restarted** → All deployed contracts are destroyed
2. **Frontend has cached addresses** from previous deployment (block 98)
3. **Current node only has 29 blocks** → Address references invalid blocks
4. **Frontend tries to query old contract addresses** → Block tag mismatch error

## ✅ Complete Solution Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Error Detection**
- Added specific detection for block tag errors
- Clear error messages explaining the issue
- Automatic identification of network state mismatches

### 2. **Automatic State Recovery**
- Frontend automatically clears cached state when block errors detected
- Provides clear instructions for resolution
- Added "Clear Cache & Reload" button for manual recovery

### 3. **Deployment Verification Script**
Created `scripts/check-deployment.js` to verify deployment status:
```bash
node scripts/check-deployment.js
```

### 4. **Improved User Experience**
- Better error messages with specific solutions
- Automatic cache clearing when issues detected
- Clear next steps provided to user

## 🔧 How to Fix This Error

### **Step 1: Redeploy Contracts**
```bash
# Make sure Hardhat node is running
cd "Lending (BC) + frontend/loan-management/backend"
npx hardhat node

# In new terminal - Deploy contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deployAll2.js --network localhost
```

### **Step 2: Verify Deployment**
```bash
# Check if contracts are properly deployed
node scripts/check-deployment.js
```

### **Step 3: Refresh Frontend**
```bash
# Start/refresh frontend
cd "Lending (BC) + frontend/loan-management/frontend"
npm run dev

# In browser:
# 1. Refresh page (F5)
# 2. Reconnect wallet
# 3. If error persists, click "Clear Cache & Reload" button
```

## 🛠️ New Tools Added

### 1. **Deployment Checker Script**
`backend/scripts/check-deployment.js`:
- ✅ Verifies all contracts are deployed
- ✅ Checks address file synchronization
- ✅ Provides clear status report
- ✅ Shows next steps if issues found

### 2. **Enhanced Frontend Error Handling**
- ✅ Detects block tag errors specifically
- ✅ Provides "Clear Cache & Reload" button
- ✅ Shows deployment command in error message
- ✅ Automatically clears invalid cached state

### 3. **Improved Deployment Script**
- ✅ Clear success message with next steps
- ✅ Automatic frontend address updates
- ✅ Better error reporting

## 🔍 Error Prevention

### **Always Follow This Sequence:**
1. **Start Hardhat node** → `npx hardhat node`
2. **Deploy contracts** → `npx hardhat run scripts/deployAll2.js --network localhost`
3. **Verify deployment** → `node scripts/check-deployment.js`
4. **Start frontend** → `cd ../frontend && npm run dev`
5. **Connect wallet** → Refresh browser and reconnect

### **When Hardhat Node Restarts:**
- ⚠️ **Always redeploy contracts** - Node is stateless
- ⚠️ **Don't just restart frontend** - Addresses will be invalid
- ⚠️ **Check deployment status** before connecting wallet

## 📋 Verification Checklist

### ✅ **Successful Deployment Should Show:**
```
🎉 DEPLOYMENT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
📋 Next Steps:
   1. Frontend addresses have been automatically updated
   2. Start/refresh your frontend: cd ../frontend && npm run dev
   3. Refresh your browser and reconnect your wallet
   4. Test the UserHistory functionality in the Dashboard
```

### ✅ **Frontend Should Connect Without Errors:**
```
Initializing contracts for network: localhost (chainId: 31337)
✅ Contracts initialized successfully
```

### ✅ **Deployment Check Should Show:**
```
🎉 All contracts are properly deployed!
✅ Frontend should be able to connect successfully.
✅ Address files are in sync.
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **If Error Persists:**
1. **Clear browser cache completely**
2. **Clear localStorage**: Open DevTools → Application → Storage → Clear All
3. **Restart browser**
4. **Verify Hardhat node is running**: Check terminal for active node
5. **Redeploy contracts**: Run deployment script again

### **If Deployment Fails:**
1. **Check Hardhat node is running**
2. **Verify no other processes using port 8545**
3. **Clear Hardhat cache**: `npx hardhat clean`
4. **Recompile contracts**: `npx hardhat compile`

## 📊 Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The system now:
- ✅ **Detects block tag errors** and provides clear solutions
- ✅ **Automatically clears invalid cached state**
- ✅ **Provides deployment verification tools**
- ✅ **Shows clear error messages with next steps**
- ✅ **Includes UserHistory functionality**
- ✅ **Handles network state mismatches gracefully**

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Follow the fix steps above** to resolve current error
2. **Test UserHistory functionality** in Dashboard
3. **Verify borrow/repay operations** update history correctly
4. **Use deployment checker** before connecting frontend

The implementation is now robust and provides clear guidance for resolving deployment sync issues!
